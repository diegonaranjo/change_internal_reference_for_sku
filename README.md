This module customizes Odoo's product views to replace the "Internal Reference" field label with "SKU" in both the backend (admin panel) and the frontend (website product page).

## Features ⭐

✅ Changes "Internal Reference" to "SKU" in the admin product form and product list views.

✅ Updates the product detail page on the website to display SKU above product attributes.

✅ Uses Odoo's inheritance system (XPath) for clean and efficient modifications.

## Customization 📝

By default, this module changes "Internal Reference" to "SKU", but you can modify it to display any term that suits your business needs.

## How to Customize the Label ✍️

In the XML files, change the "string" attribute from "SKU" to any text you want.
